# Teaching Tina
##What is this?
This is an app I'm creating to teach my severely autistic sister how to read.

It uses both deep practice and spaced repetition to teach word sounds and words.

The concept is simple.
Break a word down into it's letter pairs and practice those, then put them together to make a word.

'hello' becomes many flashcards. 'he', 'eh', 'el', 'le', 'll', 'lo', 'ol'.
We teach both 'he' and 'eh' together, because she needs to learn that we read from left to right, and because she needs to learn that a 'h' and 'e' together can make 2 different sounds.

# Deep practice
She will see the same flashcard over and over until she gets it right 5 times in a row. This constant repetition is how we learn anything and as outlines in the book The Talent Code, it's a very essential step to learning.

Even after she's seen a flashcard, and clearly knows it, she will still see it 5 times.
This increases the amount of times she sees the words, and makes sure she remembers them.

# Spaced Repetition
To understand Spaced Repetition, read up on how Anki works, as it's the best free open source flashcard program on earth :).

When a flashcard is answered accruately, it's scheduled to be reviewed at a later date.
If it's answered correctly again, it's scheduled for an even longer date.
That is the basis of spaced repetition, constantly seeing a card at longer intervals to remind you of it just before you forget it.

If she gets a flashcard wrong, just once, it's review schedule is reset and the card is treated like a new flashcard that's never been seen before.
This is slightly different from how other Spaced Repetition Software works.
The reason for this reset is because of how I've seen Tina learn.
She can learn something today with 10 minutes of explaining, and if asked about it tomorrow, she may have already forgotten it.
Because of this, I have had to re-teach her the exact same way the second day, and she's been able to learn it a bit quicker, and she remembers it the next day, but still needs to review it.
I believe that she just has a much shorter forgetting curve, or maybe she just needs a better refresher every now and again.
The best way to give her a refresher is to just get her to learn the card again as it it's new.
