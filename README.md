# Teaching Tina
## What is this?
This is an Android app I'm creating to teach my severely autistic sister how to read, and other things.
It's a flashcard app that can display text, images and audio.
It also has a maths mode for practising addition.

It uses both Deep Practice and Spaced Repetition to teach the sounds that make up words, and the words themselves.

The concept is simple.
Break a word down into it's letter pairs and practice those, then put them together to make a word.

'hello' becomes many flashcards. 'he', 'eh', 'el', 'le', 'll', 'lo', 'ol'.
We teach both 'he' and 'eh' together, because she needs to learn that we read from left to right, and because she needs to learn that a 'h' and 'e' together can make 2 different sounds.


# Deep practice
She will see the same flashcard over and over until she gets it right 5 times in a row. This constant repetition is how we learn anything and as outlined in the book The Talent Code, it's a very essential step to learning.

Even after she's seen a flashcard, and clearly knows it, she will still see it 5 times.
This increases the amount of times she sees the words, and makes sure she remembers them.

# Spaced Repetition
To understand Spaced Repetition, read up on how Anki works, as it's the best free open source flashcard program on earth :).

When a flashcard is answered accurately, it's scheduled to be reviewed at a later date.
If it's answered correctly again, it's scheduled for an even longer date.
That is the basis of spaced repetition, constantly seeing a card at longer intervals to remind you of it just before you forget it.

If she gets a flashcard wrong, just once, it's review schedule is reset and the card is treated like a new flashcard that's never been seen before.
This is slightly different from how other Spaced Repetition Software works.
The reason for this reset is because of how I've seen Tina learn.
She can learn something today with 10 minutes of explaining, and if asked about it tomorrow, she may have already forgotten it.
Because of this, I have had to re-teach her the exact same way the second day, and she's been able to learn it a bit quicker, and she remembers it the next day, but still needs to review it.
I believe that she just has a much shorter forgetting curve, or maybe she just needs a better refresher every now and again.
The best way to give her a refresher is to just get her to learn the card again as it it's new.

# Language Learning Method
She will learn a few words, and then will be asked to read a sentence with those words in it.

Each reading lesson will have it's own sentence which contains all the new words, and may contain previously learnt words.

The idea is to start with very simple sentences, with very simple words and ideas, and to eventually start writing harder sentences.

In Benny Lewis's book Fluent in 3 Months, he shares a very good method for learning vocabulary. His idea for learning a new language is to find a news article in the language you want to learn, and learn all the words it contains. Afterwards, you are able to read that news article, even though your vocabulary is quite limited, and you know nothing of the language's grammar.
By doing this, you also open yourself up to seeing the most common words in that language. Even though each article will have a few uncommon words, the majority of it will include essential words. Learning this way is a lot more rewarding that just learning a long list of vocabulary.

# What can a severely autistic person learn with this app?
Although the reading part of this app is currently a work in progress, and soon to be completed, I have used this to teach Tina a few things already.
* Addition up to 10 + 10. Before this she didn't know 1 + 1.
* The difference between the letters b, d, p & q. They all look very similar, so I found a way to show her the difference.
* All numbers up to 100. Where before she would not know the difference between 32 and 23, because they both had a 3 and a 2, she thought they were the same thing. This makes sense, because it doesn't matter if you have a "knife and a fork" or a "fork and a knife", it's the same thing.

It's not as simple as just loading up the app though. Each one of those required me to explain to Tina what she was learning and how to use the app to practice. Each bullet point requires it's own method, and the app is just used to repeat the method along with having her answer questions which enhances learning.

If anyone is interested, I could upload a video on how to teach any of these things.

I was going to teach Tina how to do larger addition like 19 + 38, but I haven't figured out how to explain how we use each column to indicate thousands, hundreds, tens, and units. That will probably be the next thing I tackle after finishing the reading lessons mode.
I'm thinking maybe some sort of animation to show a number 10 after the number 9, to reinforce how the 1 is now one column to the left.
