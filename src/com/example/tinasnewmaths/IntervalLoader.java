The app will allow me to choose the level to play.
I need to have control over this, since there is no algorithm that can help me.

Make the app have a way to make the newest note more likely to appear.
This can be done by making an arrayList of strings, and adding the same
note multiple times, whilst others only once.
When we shuffle the list, there's a statistically more chance of getting
the newest note.

We can save this 'repeat me' value in the database.

Should this value be updated once a day???



Since there will be extra new values, the new deck can handle them.
There will be several new database categories added before the questions.
